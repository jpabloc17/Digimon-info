# Digipedia

## Description

Digipedia is a single page application created with HTML, CSS and JS where we are fetching data from a free API to create cards displaying information on several digimons.

## Installation

The Digipedia can run without any additional installations. Anyone can feel free to fork and clone this repository and make their own copy. You can add your own changes to either add more functionality or modify the interface.

## Usage

On Digipedia there is a "Show all" button that can be clicked to display all the cards with the digimon's name and picture. There is a "More Info" button that can be clicked on each card to display more information about the digimon. There is also a search bar that can be used to search for a specific digimon. If the digimon is not found, a new message will be displayed on the screen and the search bar will be removed. To see the cards again there is no need to refresh the page, there is a "X" button to close the card and go back to the main page.
